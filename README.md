* TODO: 1-2 description of how you organized your code for the assignment
  
  We separated our program into the front-end (MainWindow) and the back-end 
  (CompositeModel). We put all the callbacks in MainWindow.
  
  (for the second part of the lab - filters)
  We have a filter factory and then we added that to the compositeModel. We implemented all the filters in Filter.cs.

* TODO: One thing you found annoying, interesting or challenging about the assignment

  It took us a long time to understand delegates and callbacks. Once we got passed
  the conceptual understanding, everything went much smoother. 
  
  (for the second part - filters)
  
  It took a while to figure out clamp.

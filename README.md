# Photobooth

This is a collaborative lab assignment between me and Yusuf Qaddura for Professor Aline Normoyle's Software Engineering class for Spring 2019. 
(https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~alinen/cs71/labs/lab05.html)

The project is to develop a photobooth application which users can add various gadgets of various sizes and apply additional effects to their image.

The project is written in C#. Some starter code is given by Professor Aline Normoyle. The project is for academic purposes only.
